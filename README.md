This repository contains the replication code for the article “Household Debt Holdings and Debt Ratio Dynamics in South Korea and China,” published in the Journal of Asian and African Studies. 
The code reproduces the regression results reported in Tables 5–8 (regressions) of the paper and Figures in manuscript.
Due to file size constraints, the raw household-level data cannot be uploaded to this repository.
Researchers who wish to access the data for replication purposes may contact the author directly at kyuyeonhwang@ruc.edu.cn, and the data will be provided upon request.
